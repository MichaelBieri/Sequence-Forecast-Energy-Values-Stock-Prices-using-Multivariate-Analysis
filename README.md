# Sequence Learning: Predicting Prices using Multivariate Analysis
## I) Abstract
This repository show two models to predict the energy price from swiss energy data.

## II) Introduction
The project tries two different RNN to forecast energy price. Linear regression assumptions (like ARIMA) only consider one factor while forecasting (non-linear univariate models like ARCH, TAR and deep learning models). The energy price is dynamic and dependents on many economic and political factors at the same time.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and its extensions like GRU and LSTM has show in sequential data like sound waves, time series variations and in natural language processing.

In this projec I try to use RNN namely Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) to model. It is proven that deep learning algorithms have the ability to identify existing patterns in the data and exploiting them by using a soft learning process. Unlike other statistical and machine learning algorithms, deep learning architectures are capable to find short term as well as long term dependencies in the data and give good predictions by finding these hidden relationships. The difficulty will be to manage with a very small amount of data.

## III) Literature Review
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): RNN are a class of ANNs where the output from previous step are fed as input to the current step along with the normal input. In feed forward ANNs, all the inputs and outputs are independent of each other, but in cases like when it is required to predict the time series, the previous values are required and hence there is a need to remember the previous values. RNN suffers from vanishing gradient problem. As the error propagates through the network, it passes through the temporal loop—the hidden layers connected over time by weights. This repeated application causes the gradient to decline rapidly, leading to slower updates for the weights of layers on the far left compared to the far right. This issue, known as the vanishing gradient problem, affects the entire network's training. To address this, Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber proposed the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network in 1997.
LSTM uses the following gates to solve the problem:
Forget Gate: If set to true, the cell forgets the information coming from previous layers.
Input Gate: Chooses which value from input is going to update the memory state.
Output Gate: Chooses what will be the cell output on the basis of input and memory of the cell.
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU): It is a variation of RNN introduced by Kyunghyun Cho et al in 2014. It is like a LSTM unit without an output gate. It has fewer parameters than LSTM and have less complexity. GRU have shown better performance than LSTM on certain smaller datasets, but it is still weaker than LSTM overall.

Units: energie in GWh and cent/kWh

Electricity tariffs Electricity prices are composed of:
Grid fee Price for transporting electricity from the power plant to the home. The revenue is used to finance the maintenance and expansion of the electricity grid, for example overhead lines, pylons and transformers. Energy price for the electrical energy supplied. The grid operator either generates this energy with its own power plants or buys it from upstream suppliers. The energy price is also influenced by the type of energy source. A high share of renewable energy (e.g. wind, solar, biomass energy) usually leads to higher energy prices. Municipality taxes Municipal and cantonal taxes and fees. These include, for example, concession fees or local political energy levies. Aidfee Federal tax for the promotion of renewable energies, and the protection of waters and fish. The amount of the aidfee is set annually by the Federal Council. The levy is the same everywhere. These components vary across:
Time products consumption categories energy providers municipalities The place where you live, the consumption category to which you belong, the energy provider you chose, and the product you subscribed for will affect your monthly bills.

Data Pre-processing:
1. A Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test showed that the time series is not stationary. ARIMA and SARIMAX not possible because of non seasonal data.
2. First, we remove some redundant and noisy data, such as the records with volume 0 and the records that are identical to previous record. For unifying the data range, we applied Min-Max normalization and mapped the values to a range of 0 to 1.
3. The data was split into train, validation and test data. The training data contains records from 1 Jan 1997 to 31 Dec 2006, validation data contains records from 1 Jan 2007 to 31 Dec 2008 and test data contains records from 1 Jan 2009 to 31 Dec 2010.

Testing and Error Calculation:
Each model has been tested on the test set and their Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R2-score are calculated.

Parameters:
Model 1 - Univariate-LSTM/Multivariate-LSTM
Timesteps: 40
Neurons in each Layer: 40 and 35
Learning Rate: 0.001
Batch Size: 64
Total Trainable Parameters: 17408
The training data is fed to this network and the model is trained for 250 epochs on the training data and validated by the validation data.

Model 2 - Multivariate-GRU
The model is trained on the series of records containing High price (Highest Correlation with target), Volume (Lowest Correlation with target) and Close price of the stock. Different parameters of this ANN are as follows:

Timesteps: 40
Neurons in each Layer: 40 and 35
Learning Rate: 0.0001
Batch Size: 64
Total Trainable Parameters: 13359
The training data is fed to this network and the model is trained for 150 epochs on the training data and validated by the validation data.

## V) Tools and Technology Used
We used Python syntax for this project. As a framework we used Keras, which is a high-level neural network API written in Python. But Keras can’t work by itself, it needs a backend for low-level operations. For that I installed the software library "Google’s TensorFlow".
For scientific computation, we installed Scipy. As a development environment we used the Anaconda Distribution and Jupyter Notebook. We used Matplotlib for data visualization, Numpy for various array operations and Pandas for data analysis.

## VI) Results
ARIMA and SARIMA are not usable. The GRU models deliver more realistic data.
In case of the small data volume the GRU model is the best solution.
